    of the option is a comman-separated list of MIC features which have to be
    disabled and instead, will be done in the installer. For example,
    "installerfw_plugins=bootloader" disables all the MIC code which installs
    the bootloader to the target images, and instead, the bootlodaer will be
    installed by the installer framework plugin.

    The plugin is a program which is external to MIC, it comes from the
    installation repositories and can be executed by MIC in order to perform
    various configuration actions. The main point here is to make sure MIC has
    no hard-wired knoledge about the target OS configuration. """
